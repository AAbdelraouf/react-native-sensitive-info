You can easily contribute by cloning react-native-sensitive-info's repository and using our [example project](https://github.com/mCodex/react-native-sensitive-info/tree/master/example) to develop new feature or fix opened issues.

To do so, the easiest way is using [yalc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yalc) which is a great tool to develop locally. Go to react-native-sensitive-info root folder and run:

```bash
yalc publish
```

After that, go to `example` folder and run:

```bash
yalc add react-native-sensitive-info --yarn
```

Then you are ready to build and run the example like a regular React-Native application.
