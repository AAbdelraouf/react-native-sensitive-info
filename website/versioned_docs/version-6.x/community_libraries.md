### redux-persist-sensitive-storage

If you would like to use [redux-persist](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist) to store information from your Redux state into secure storage, you can use [redux-persist-sensitive-storage](https://github.com/CodingZeal/redux-persist-sensitive-storage) which uses [react-native-sensitive-info](https://github.com/mCodex/react-native-sensitive-info) under the hood.
